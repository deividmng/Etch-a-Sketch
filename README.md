# Etch-a-Sketch
![v1.1](/assets/v1.1.png)
This webpage is a digital version of the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. It allows users to draw on a grid of square divs by hovering the mouse over them. The grid size can be changed dynamically based on user input. Part of the challenge was to render the grid using flexbox instead of css grid.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox)
- JavaScript

## Features
- Paint random colors with the "Random" button.
- Clean your drawing.
- Resize the grid.

## How to Use
- The initial grid size is set to 16x16.
- Hover over the grid squares to draw on them.
- Use the input field and the "Resize grid!" button to change the - size of the grid.
- Click the "Resize grid!" button to generate a new grid with the specified size.
- Click the "Clear" button to clean up your drawing.
- Click the "Random" button to enable random color painting, you can also go back to the standard color mode.

## What I learnt
- Creating HTML elements with JS.
- Appending children to HTML elements.
- Adding classes through `classList`.
- Managing event listeners.
- Retrieving and working with user input.

## Challenges and Future Improvements
- The current implementation does not include advanced styling and is focused on functionality.
- The JavaScript code is to be refactored to improve readability and maintainability.
- Additional features are to be added.
